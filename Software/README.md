MicroBlocks is a free, Scratch-like blocks programming language for learning physical computing with educational microcontroller boards such as the micro:bit, Adafruit Circuit Playground Express, and many others. MicroBlocks is a live environment. Click on a block and it runs immediately, right on the board. Try out commands. See and graph sensor values in real time. No more waiting for code to compile and download.

At the heart of Picobricks is the Raspberry Pi Pico. The Thonny Raspberry Pi is a great choice for coding Pico and therefore Picobricks.
 - ##### [Arduino IDE ](http://www.arduino.cc/en/software "Arduino IDE ")

Picobricks offers us the opportunity to code with Arduino C. Getting started coding the Raspberry Pi Pico at the heart of Picobricks with the widely used Arduino IDE is pretty easy.
 ## Useful Information
 If you rename your code file to main.py, your code will run after every boot.
